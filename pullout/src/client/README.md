## Description
User client that will be installed for anyone who wants to use our application

## Development
This is the same as when we had it as our prototype
```bash
poetry install
```

```bash
poetry run pullout -h
```

It is possible to see what each filter does, how it processes. Just uncomment the lines in img_preprocessor
