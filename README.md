# Vilnius University IT course projects
During my stay in Vilnius university I have created a few projects and I want to showcase them here.
Each project has its own folder. I added screenshots and everything that was done in it so there is no need to download and setup everything to see the end result.

These projects were made on gitlab in Vilnius University git.mif.vu.lt and ported over to github to showcase. Reports and slides were created on Overleaf LaTeX.

The things that are not included are tasks, milestones and git commit history that were created on gitlab.
