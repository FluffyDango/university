We had to do presentations on our progress and technical overview of our project. This happened every two or three weeks. There were 3 lecturers who always listened and evaluated our presentations and asked difficult questions. I have only added my presentation.

There is the HCI (human computer interactions) which talks more about UI/UX part of web development

Next is the project report. This was the whole semester work in order to document and show what the software is all about.
